# StockPortfolioData
This Python code will allow you to download multiple stock prices for different tickers. For example, I have a 20 stock portfolio and instead of using Yahoo finance and gather the data one by one, I simply run this code. It can be extremely useful if there are weeks or monthsâ€™ worth of prices to download.

Period = ['1d', '5d', '1mo', '3mo', '6mo', '1y', '2y', '5y', '10y', 'ytd', 'max']")
