# StockPortfolioData
This Python code will allow you to download multiple stock prices for different tickers. For example, I have a 20 stock portfolio and instead of using Yahoo finance and gather the data one by one, I simply run this code. It can be extremely useful if there are weeks or monthsâ€™ worth of prices to download.
